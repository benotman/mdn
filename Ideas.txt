/*
   send element id only
   I can have a property of the svg_id in each element
   in generic event handler, extract the svg_id when calling connections
   
hover 
  I need to save regular, hover, select, and related colours 
    hover (change current element using hover class e.g. diagram1:hover fill = )
    mousehover
      related elements -> save their style then change their style
    mouseout
      related elements -> go back to original style

    click_event	 
	  if(current is unselected or highlighted)
         change current to selected
	     highlight_related(viewid, id)
	  else // current is selected
		 if (highlight_count >0)
			change current to highlighted
         else
            change current to regular
         end if
		 unhighlight_related(viewid, id)
      end if		 
      related elements -> 

regular, selected, highlighted	 
   show related content (button)	 
      
  class hover can change current element 
  change class
