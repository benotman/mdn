Drupal module for Multiple Diagram navigation 

Multiple Diagram Navigation is a Drupal module that allows site owners to incorporate diagrams, maps, info graphics, and other visual structures in their sites. The goal of using diagrams is to provide an multiple overviews to the site. The site users can look at the diagrams to get an overview of the content and see the multiple facets of the content. MDN allows users to click or select elements (such as shapes) in the diagrams to retrieve nodes (pages) related to these elements. Also MDN highlights elements in the diagrams that are related to the page the user is reading and can include pages the user has visited so far.
